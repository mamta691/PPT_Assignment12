    "# Cost Optimization:\n",
    "# 6. Q: How can cost optimization be achieved in machine learning projects?\n",
    "Cost optimization in machine learning projects can be achieved by using data-driven approaches that leverage historical data on sales, customer behavior, and market trends to determine the most effective prices to set. Machine learning optimization is the process of adjusting hyperparameters in order to minimize the cost function by using one of the optimization techniques. It is important to minimize the cost function because it describes the discrepancy between the true value of the estimated parameter and what the model has predicted1.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods and techniques for ML optimization such as gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent, momentum, Nesterov accelerated gradient, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam1.\n",
    "# 7. Q: How do you balance cost optimization and model performance in machine learning projects?\n",
    "In machine learning projects, cost optimization and model performance are two important factors that need to be balanced. The cost function is used to gauge the performance of the machine learning model. A machine learning model devoid of the cost function is futile. The cost function helps to analyze how well a machine learning model performs. A cost function basically compares the predicted values with the actual values1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization is measured through a loss or cost function, which is typically a way of defining the difference between the predicted and actual value of data. Machine learning models aim to minimize this loss function, or lower the gap between prediction and reality of output data2. Gradient descent is the most common algorithm for model optimization for minimizing the error. In order to perform gradient descent, you have to iterate over the training dataset while re-adjusting the model. Your goal is to minimize the cost function because it means you get the smallest possible error and improve the accuracy of the model3.\n",

    "Then, you’ll initialize the streaming context. Step three is to fetch the data from the streaming platform.\n",
    "Next, you’ll transform the data. \n",
    "The fifth step is to manage the pipeline to ensure everything is working as it’s supposed to.\n",

    "There are several ways to ensure cost optimization while maintaining high-performance levels in a machine learning project. One of the key methods of optimizing cost and performance is by parallelizing the workload with the help of parallel run step in Azure Machine Learning.
